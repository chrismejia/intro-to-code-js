 * b) Define andFalse. Use two of the givens and the && operator so that the evaluated value is false. Make sure to export it.
 *
 * OR (||)
 * c) Define orTrue. Use two of the givens and the || operator so that the evaluated value is true. Make sure to export it.
 * d) Define orFalse. Use two of the givens and the || operator so that the evaluated value is true. Make sure to export it.
