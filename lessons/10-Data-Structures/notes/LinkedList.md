# Linked Lists

## What is a linked list?

A linked list is an ordered collection of data elements. A linked list is made up of data notes that contain two bits of information, sometimes three : the data value, the pointer to the next node, the pointer to the previous node (in the case of a doubly linked list).

## How is an array different from a linked list?

- Arrays use indexes as a refenence because their data is contiguous whereas linked lists use pointers as a reference because the bits of data are not always in the same place. The pointers direct you down to the next element on the list based on what the pointers say.
