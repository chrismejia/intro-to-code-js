# Async/Await & APIs

## Lesson Plan

This unit introduces students to asynchronous JavaScript concepts with a focus on using `async/await` and interacting with APIs. The unit will begin by covering callback functions and how they relate to asynchronous code, then transition to using promises, and finally introduce `async/await` syntax for cleaner, more readable asynchronous operations. Real-world API calls will be demonstrated and practiced to solidify these concepts.
